-GLOBAL: Updated Avast core scanner to v1.0.1.2290 in main module

-CLI: Enabled "Automatic Update Checking" when launching the PCL. It can be changed in the "/data/config/pcl.ini" file. This was solely done because I am assuming most people that use this tool do not see the update option! Maybe I am wrong?

-CLI: Changed the behavior of "Automatic Update Checking" option on launch to skip interaction if user version matches server version

-CLI: Changed the default output for update status check from displaying inside terminal window to a msgbox instead

v0.7.8

-*** QUICKFIX RELEASE ***

-GLOBAL: The "OllyDBG' forensics module has been updated to a barebones clean version after receiving false positives from some antivirus. OllyDBG is a Windows debugging tool, therefore some of its plugins can be considered malicious if in the wrong hands. The new module has been uploaded to VirusTotal and the scan is now clean.

v0.7.3

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Further cleaned up redundant code, and modularized scripts to work more seamlessly together using global variables

-Split all main sub-menu scripts into separate scripts that act as "Linux-Like" functions, and can be triggered globally by easy to remember variables

-Updated "exitStatus" global function to help properly navigate when a script reaches EOF. Currently supports "back", "close", "return", and "exit" statuses

-Moved Auto Mode script into "data\scripts\ui\auto\main.cmd". This does not affect the end-user, and does not display any visual differences

-Split the Main Expert Menu into separate scripts, now located under "data\scripts\ui\expert". This allows for menus to be easily added, modified, or removed and keep global variables in use

-Updated "unpack-upx" script for global use to unpack UPX compressed files

-Added "ui" to scripts. This directory contains a folder for each UI Mode (auto, easy, expert). This also allows for other modes to be added without too much code overhead

-Added "updateFailLimit" to "config/modules.ini". You can use this to manually set the limit of failed update attempts before asking to continue

-Updated module scripting to better handle checking for updates and retrying updates if they fail, or the user can choose to continue without updates

-Added "checkNetworkStatus" checks to all main sub-menus. This keeps the network status correct and eliminates errors or false detections during menu transitions

v0.7.2

-Compacted and cleaned up a lot of orphaned and redundant code throughout the entire PCL structure

-Updated code for all module handling into a more uniform and organized format. All modes (auto, easy, expert) can use the same modules without having to write extra code

-Added "safeModeCheck" to pcl.ini for enabling and disabling (this is primarily a testing option and should remain ON during normal use)

-Added "check-pe-mode" to scripts. This is also set in the global script, and can be disabled from pcl.ini config file

-Fixed "Restart Explorer Shell" option under Reboot Menu

-Fixed a variable issue with psexec getting loaded for launching system related tasks

-Cleaned up scripting and bin directories

-Updated "RemoveIt Pro" update script. It now downloads the new EXE from server and extracts INNO installer to update scanner, definitions, and module

-Moved "md5toggle" in "config/pcl.ini" from [options] to [updates] since this is only triggered as part of the update process



v0.7.1

-Fixed PCL update script globally. This version has fixed all known issues and can properly download and extract updates going forward. If you are on v0.7.0, the update process will download the zip and extract it, but it will not remove old files and the script will stop after extraction and the command window must be closed manually

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Added "get-local-config" to scripts. This reads INI values and overwrites global defaults, if value is present. This is processed on initial launch, and when the "init" and "reset" commands are issued

-Updated the main PCL script and split each UI mode option to a different script located in scripts folder. This allows for better portability and more fine tuned global access to all PCL items

-Added "init" and "reset" to Expert Main Menu. These are not hidden keywords, but rather two special menu items that can be typed to restart the main PCL script in 2 different ways. The "init" option reloads global variables, and the "reset" option retains them while clearing the PCL cache

-Fixed Sophos scanning module "Double Launch" issue in Auto Mode

-Updated some of the "Web Browser Manager" options under Main Expert Menu

-Fixed "checkUAC" script not executing for disabling User Access Control. The last version did not process the pipe "|" correctly after activating the set-global script

-Added GUI wait dialogs during operations that take a significant amount of time. These may also display additional help text, when available

-Fixed Option 7 under Manual Malware Common Directories Menu. The missing option was "My Documents" directory

-Fixed a few issues with pulling dumped data back to source media under Forensics Menu

-Added paths for AppData\Local, LocalLow, and Roaming for SYSTEM account to Common Directories on Manual Malware Menu

-Fixed a bug in Auto Mode that was causing the "detectme" files to get deleted before the module was unpacked. This caused the "auto" flag to not trigger when launching module, defaulting to "Expert" scan options for some

-Fixed another bug in Auto Mode causing the update script not to trigger in modules before scanning, if network connection is online

-Added "fixprinter" command to hidden keywords. This will run a script to stop spooler, clear spool directory, and restart print spooler

-Updated the default help text when selecting the Help Option from Main Expert Menu

-Updated "System Explorer" module to v6.0.1.5281 under diagnostics

-Added "Fiddler v2.4.9.6" custom portable version to modules and Utilities Menu

-Added "McAfee Virus Scan" to cleaning modules and Malware Scanners menu. Also added the module to run in Auto Mode 

-Changed the order of a few items under Manual Removal -> Other Scripts and Tweaks

-Added "getwallpaper" to list of hidden keywords. This will run the "wallpaper-thief" script and dump system wallpapers to easily copy to another source. This is way off base for the PCL, but as a tech, I felt it was needed ;)

-Added "%ProgramData%\pcl\" to cleanup list when exiting. This folder is used for registry dumps and other temp files when PCL is in use



v0.6.6

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Updated "checkNetwork" script to determine the status based on Windows version to handle the different outputs properly when offline and online

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Added full support for Windows 10 Technical Preview and future builds. Tested all modules with Scan, Update, and Repack options

-Updated some routines to use virtual writable paths for the PCL module temp building process. This affected the "Update and Repack" option under Malware Scanners. All scripting should now be compatible with Windows 10 and earlier versions

-Added Windows 10 to the "checkOS" script

-Fixed text error on menu for "Windows Registry Recovery". It was mislabled as "Windows Registry Repair"

-Removed "uimode" from hidden keywords because it has been deprecated

v0.6.4

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Added defragmentation of main hard drive to Auto Mode using WinContig (thanks Chad!). It will run silently and unattended after scanners are complete

-Updated SuperAntiSpyware core files in module to v6.0.1146. Also fully supports portable mode with the new UI, for both x86 and x64 scanners

-Added baddie folder removal to accompany the .lnk and .url removals for Start Menu in rmLoop script

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Added "uninstallAV.txt" and "uninstallAVMSI.txt" to "data/scripts/lists/" to hold a list of Antivirus that can be optionally uninstalled

-Added "Emsisoft" to Auto Mode and added "detectme" checks

-Fixed "detectme" file error in bitdefender module for Auto Mode ONLY

-Moved %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% variable check in "checkos.cmd" script to happen before checking directories. This avoids detecting a 64-bit processor, but having a 32-bit OS installed and the %OS% variable getting set as 64-bit

-Cleaned up old "sav32cli" files in Sophos module. Only the original EXE and DLL files were left and archived in "/data/old.zip". This saves about 95MB of space from previous module

-Fixed "Forensics Mode" option not showing up under Manual Malware Removal menu

-Changed and fixed some text on multiple menus

-Added "blacklist.txt", "greylist.txt", and "whitelist.txt" to "/data/scripts/lists/". This will be used by Forensics Mode to try and determine which folders and files are potential "baddies", based on known "good guys" and known baddies. Archives can then be made in future builds to automatically "quarantine" potential baddies for analysis. Parts of Auto Mode will incorporate this to a smaller extent

-Added Sophos to Auto Mode and now checks for "detectme" files

-Added a /wait switch for Sophos scanner in Auto Mode

-Removed vipre from Auto Mode until it can be launched and wait for the next action to happen

-Fixed dead link issue for Sophos updates. Now using SVRT as scanner. New links pointing to the "Sophos Virus Removal Tool" are now referenced

-Fixed Sophos update script to now handle the new (again) format. This time it extracts the RAR SFX archive, extracts the MSI file, then copies the updated contents to the module

-Removed Clamwin from Auto Mode scanners until both updates and scanning scripts can be launched unattended

-Updated CCleaner to v4.17.4808. Both x86 and x64 versions were updated in PCL module

-Removed "Counter Status" from top menu bar and replaced with "Network Status" display

-Added SFC Scan (System File Checker) to Auto Mode and the Manual Malware Removal menu on expert mode

-Added "clamwin" and "mcafee-stinger" modules to Auto Mode, and added "detectme" support to both

-Added a default for all modules to use "Scan Only" mode if no selection is made and ENTER is pressed

v0.6.1

-This is a QuickFix Update Release. Tested this time, haha sorry, got excited about the last release too soon :)

-Added Vipre Rescue Scanner to the Auto Mode list of tasks to perform

-Fixed the detectme files not writing to the temp folder when the scannerActive variable changes

-Added some common silent switches to the uninstall routines. This will hopefully automate most of the uninstalls without having to click YES or UNINSTALL on each one. This will be better supported in future releases

-Fixed the rmLoop script from double launching in Auto Mode



v0.6.0

-Added a file check for "ui.%mode%" (ie /data/ui.menu, /data/ui.auto, /data/ui.easy, and /data/ui.expert). The value read from here will override and set the default ui type on launch. This is easily changeable by simply renaming the file to whatever mode you want to force. If you manually type a mode using keywords, or use the "change-ui" script from the main menu, then the selected mode will launch as normal and when execution is done it will return to the "ui.%mode%" file value



v0.5.9

-Updated definitions for all compatible portable malware scanners

-Added scripting for both Linux and Windows to download Microsoft Security Essentials update files directly to source media. They are located in "/data/scripts/linux/" and "/data/scripts/updates/" respectively

This can be used for Scan, Update, and Repack options. These options will be menu selectable after tested further. As is, it seems to work as intended

-Added the ability to change the destination directory for Module Injection. The Base Path will remain the same (%module%\data\) to avoid issues, but any new directories can be created and used after "\data\". If you changed it to "injected", then the new full path would be "%module%\data\injected\"

-Added "Norton Power Eraser" to "\data\modules\cleaning\tools\" and also added to Rootkit and Other Scanners menu

-Added basic framework scripting for new module system. This will make it easier to integrate all the types of tools with launch, update, and repack options, if applicable. I will be slowly migrating all modules to the new format as I have time to test them. In future updates, the new module system will be able to create portable modules for many different scanners and programs, semi-automatically, even using some setup EXE files as source
